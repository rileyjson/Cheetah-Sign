# Business Requirements

**BR1: We need an in-house application used by Administrators to send and track legal documents to clients, allow 
clients to sign them, and then return and store the document for safekeeping.**

This is the heart of the assignment. Typically for this role, organizations would use DocuSign.
DocuSign is a powerful tool, but it is also expensive, requiring paid API access. Cheetah Sign, as a project, is meant
to replace DocuSign for administrators to reduce the cost that would typically go into paying for DocuSign.
