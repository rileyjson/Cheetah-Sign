# Cheetah Sign Tech Stack

This is an outline of the tech stack chosen for the Cheetah Sign project and the reason behind those choices. These technologies were selected by the client to meet their specific requirements. All new and subsequent products that support Cheetah are built with this stack. To get us started we will be provided with a template that is used for all new Cheetah products.

## Frontend

**Frameworks** - [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
<br>
**CSS Frameworks** -

Vue.js is a popular open-source JavaScript framework that is used to create interactive user interfaces and single-page applications. It was praised by our client for being easier to learn and having much better syntax than other Javascript frameworks. Along with it being easier to learn, it has a large community with plenty of documentation and tutorials.

## Backend

**Framework** - [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) (C#)
<br>
**Database** - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

.NET is a open-source and cross-platform framework that is primarily used for building high-performance web applications. .NET supports multiple programming languages but we will be using C# for Cheetah Sign. C# is an object-oriented programming language that is run on the .NET framework.

PostgreSQL (Postgres) is an open-source relational database management system. Though we were given the option of using Microsoft SQL Server, our client preferred we used Postgres.

For connecting our .NET backend to our database, we will be using Microsoft's Entity Framework as recommended by our client.

## IDE/Text Editor

**Frontend** - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
<br>
**Backend** - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight code editor that offers support for extensions. These extensions can you help you customize your development by adding new features. It has plenty of great extensions for Vue.js, which make the development experience even better. Also, all group members are very comfortable with it, which will make collaboration easier. Since our frontend will not be as large-scale as the backend, VSCode will be perfect for the job.

On the other hand, Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which is usually the preferred environment for .NET and C# development. Unlike VS Code, which requires setting up a lot of extensions to match specific needs, Visual Studio comes with everything out of the box. It provides great support for our backend technologies without needing to download additional tools or extensions.
