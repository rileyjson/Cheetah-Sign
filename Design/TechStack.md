# Cheetah Sign Tech Stack

This is an outline of the tech stack chosen for the Cheetah Sign project and the reason behind those choices. The tech stack was selected by the client to meet their specific requirements.
All new and subsequent products that support Cheetah are built with this stack. To get us started with the stack, we will be provided with a template that is used for all new Cheetah products. It will have our backend server setup and our Vue.js frontend setup.

## Frontend

Frameworks - [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
<br>
CSS Frameworks -

Vue.js is a popular open-source JavaScript framework that is used to create interactive user interfaces and single-page applications. It was praised by our client for being easier to learn and having much better syntax than something like React. Along with it being easier to learn, it has a large community with plenty of documentation and tutorials.

## Backend

Framework - [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) (C#)
<br>
Database - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

.NET is a open-source and cross-platform framework developed by Microsoft that is primarily used for building high-performance web applications. .NET supports multiple programming languages but we will be using C# for Cheetah Sign. C# is an object-oriented programming language that is run on the .NET framework.

PostgreSQL (Postgres) is an open-source relational database management system. Though we were given the option of using Microsoft SQL Server, our clients preferred we used Postgres.

For connecting our .NET backend to our database, we will be using Microsoft's Entity Framework as recommended by our client.

## IDE/Text Editor

Frontend - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
<br>
Backend - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight code editor with support for extensions. These extensions can you help you customize your development by adding new features. It has plenty of great extensions for Vue.js, so it is perfect for our frontend.

Visual Studio is an IDE that is usually the preferred enviroment for .NET and C# development. It comes with everything out of the box so we don't have to download a lot of extensions to get a good enviroment.
