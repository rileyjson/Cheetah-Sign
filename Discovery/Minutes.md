## Topics Discussed

Introductions between the student team and Accutech, discussion around the project that led to a well-thought-out list 
of requirements and a order that the project should be worked on in. Requirements that were discussed include:
- Cheetah sign will be developed for Windows.
- Cheetah sign as a program will be primarily used by Cheetah Flow Administrators, not the clients.
- Cheetah sign will be developed with .NET, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL
- The student team is not responsible for making the Cheetah Sign program follow the requirements that make Cheetah Sign Documents legally binding agreements.
- While cheetah sign will potentially be integrated into the Cheetah flow program, this is out of scope for the students.
- 

## Things Clarified

Updated documents containing the proper information will be sent throughout the teams and students are good to begin development on the project. Students should first focus on making a basic GUI where documents can be uploaded and signed first.
