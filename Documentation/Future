Cheetah Sign Future:

Current Issues: 

- Sometimes when uploading documents, the database will reorder them and they will not appear in the order of upload
- Sometimes after sending documents, the database will reorder the jobs and they will not appear in the order they were sent

Potential Issues:

- When highlighting each input step on the PDF for signer, it's possible that it can highlight incorrect text if you have text in your PDF that is the same as your input step

Possible Improvements:

- Find a way to prevent the database from reordering its fields
- Make a PDF sendable to multiple people for signing, and specfiy only their corresponding text boxes to sign
