## Topics Discussed

Discussed the new accutech template for the BSU cheetahsign and how it should be used. Our entire team now has access to the new
template and can begin development. We discussed how to best organize the materials within the respository. Ryland has
admin access to the repository, so if any major changes need made, we will have to confer with him. We discussed how we might
go about implementing authentication and the web applications. Finally, we went over how docker works.

## Things Clarified

The discussion helped us determine how docker works, as well as where is the best place to start with development. Now that we
have our template with the proper tools, we can get started on development - Riley and I working on backend, Tia working on
frontend, and Hunter helping with connections and interactions.
