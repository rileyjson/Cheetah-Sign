## Topics Discussed

Showed off iteration 1 in this meeting! We displayed all the features present in iteration 1, including
- The ability to upload documents
- The ability to create jobs
- The ability to view documents
- The ability to sign jobs.

Accutech seems very impressed with the first iteration! We have made good steps forward, and we're happy to see a
strong response the amount of progress we've made.

## Things Clarified

Accutech expressed that they would like our priority to be focusing on rendering a pdf file in the document for the second
iteration. It is a massive priority for them that users are able to view and sign the document as if it was on their desk,
rather than a document that feels like it just exists on a seperate space on the internet. Other aspects, such as the audit
trail and multi-paging is important, but they would like a focus on that PDF rendering.
