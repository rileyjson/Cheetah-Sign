## Topics Discussed

We discussed the design materials that have been created so far. Gabe suggested improvements and showed where he felt our
design materials met the requirements. We worked together to find out more details about important aspects of the project,
such as the version of Vue we will be using and what style we are aiming for.

## Things Clarified

The plan for next week is to continue to develop the design materials and to put them together into a presentation for the
class.
