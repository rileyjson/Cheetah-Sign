## Topics Discussed

We discussed a proper starting point for the project and the priorities we have laid out so far. We handled a few issues with
ensuring that everyone has proper access to the template and can get work done on their jobs. We conferred with Gabe about
what needs to be finished before the end of Iteration 1, and how we plan to handle them in which order - primarily focusing
on the ability to upload a document first, then the ability to "sign" and send to the client, and then the clients ability
to "sign" and send back.

## Things Clarified

Our plan is to keep in close contact with Gabe as we progress as a source of information. He's significantly more familiar 
with the AccuTech template, and should be a great help. We'll keep moving forward with our work and priorities, and shouldn't
have any more issues getting started as we move forward.
