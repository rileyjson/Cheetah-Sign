## Topics Discussed

This meeting was meant to show Gabriel the progress that we have so far on iteration 2 and describe what features we plan 
to show off in the iteration 2 client meeting. Here, we showed off the email and document edit functionality. We demonstrated
how each job is now sent to the client via email, and how the client is able to click on it to get to their own document. We also
showed off how the UI is better separated and each area is its own. Finally, we showed off the new document editing
features, and how boxes can be placed as needed. 

## Things Clarified

In the next few days, we plan to work on combining the features that we have together. Currently, the document editing and
the email features are on separate branches, so they need to be combined. Also, we have plans to implement a simple delete
button for the documents. Gabriel commented on how this is good progress, and can't wait to see the program in its entirety
come wednesday for the full client meeting.
