## Topics Discussed

We used this meeting to discuss the current workings on the project. We talked about the recent developments made to our
program to ensure it can work on several browsers. Furthermore, we showed off the new testing and the automated systems
to allow for tests automatically on PR's, resulting in more consistent commits without any issues.

## Things Clarified

We discussed our plans for what we'll be working on in the future. Riley is taking a heavy emphasis on the PDF reader, 
ensuring that it will work across several browsers and be intuitive to use. Levi is focusing on implementing the new tests,
and then implementing the functionality for the audit trail on the different documents. Tia will be focused on creating
the GUI for the audit trail and helping out wherever needed. Hunter is focused on cleanup around the features and helping with
tests.
