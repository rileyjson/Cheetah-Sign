## Topics Discussed

This is the mentor meeting right before the client meeting! We used this meeting to discuss our current changes and what
we will be showing off in the client meeting. We showed Gabe the new features, including the new audit trail, document builder,
and the document signatures.

## Things Clarified

Gabe told us that he really liked the changes we made! He liked the progress we are making, especially the progress made with
the document builder. He communicated that he's been keeping an eye on the Slack progress, and says that it's good that we know
when to ask for help, and how to move forward with our program properly. He is excited for future iterations, and is looking
forward to the developments that we'll make with the document builder.
