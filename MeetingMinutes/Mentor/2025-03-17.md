## Topics Discussed

This is the mentor meeting right before the client meeting! We showed Gabe our documentation as well as the features that we
have implemented. He seems very happy with the progress, and likes a lot of the testing work that we've put in. Specifically,
he noted that the UI looks a lot better, and that the new document builder features are very interesting, they just need a bit of
polish. 

## Things Clarified

Gabe would really like us to focus on the document builder. The client functionality is also nice, but it doesn't need to be
focused on as much - or, if it is focused on, it should tie back into the document builder. Overall, he's very happy with how
far the project has come over iteration 4. We used this time to discuss how the client meeting would go, and to ensure that
the client would have a way of running our project.
