## Topics Discussed

As a checkup meeting, this didn't take very long and wasn't very intensive. We had Riley present our program with the new
UI changes and the endpoint functionality. The main changes were in the visual aspects and showing off how the document signing
process has been adjusted. 

## Things Clarified

Overall, the project looks nice! Gabe didn't have very much to say in regard to feedback. Overall, he likes the direction
we are taking with both the UI and the functionality, so we will stick with this path moving forward!
