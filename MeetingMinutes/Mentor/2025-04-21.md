## Topics Discussed

This is our last meeting with Gabriel! We used this meeting to show off our final changes for iteration 5, and how it looks
for the program overall. The main changes we implemented were the drag and drop, resizing, and form filling. Gabriel really
liked these changes, and is very happy with the UI difference as well. Overall, the program looks much cleaner with 
much more quality of life.

## Things Clarified

Gabriel likes the direction we've taken with the program. He's very happy with the progress we've made, and has commented
that this feels like a complete program, rather than a project in development. We're all very happy with the progress, and
think that the iteration 5 version of our project will be a complete product that Accutech can use right out of the gate!
