## Topics Discussed

Discussed the assignments that will be due from today through the design presentations on October 3rd. Sent a message to 
mentor to plan a mentor meeting, and started Tia on sending an email to a client for the design meeting. Plan is to have 
mentor meeting on Wednesday 25th, and client meeting on Friday 27th. Discussed what needs to be addressed in the meeting,
and made a plan to have a rough draft of each design material by the mentor meeting for refinement.

## Things Clarified

Plan for next week is to prepare the design presentation for class after working with the mentor and the client 
to ensure the requirements are up to par.
