## Topics Discussed

This time was primarily used to work on the Design Materials to ensure that they would be ready on time for the Mentor 
Meeting. We spent this time planning out a basic design for the GUI and distributing the design materials amongst members.
The materials will be uploaded to GitHub on a steady basis and reviewed by each of the team members to ensure they fit
the requirements, then shown at the mentor meeting for another review before client meeting and presentation.

## Things Clarified

Plan for next week is to prepare the presentation based off of the finished design materials and be ready to show it to
the class after meeting with the client.
