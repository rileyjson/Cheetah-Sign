## Topics Discussed

We used this time to check up on everyone's progress and ensure things are still going smoothly. There have been
some difficulties getting used to vue and node.js, but we've gotten better at working with them. Our four main priorities
are allowing the upload of documents, the sending of documents, a button declaring a document has been signed, and then
the ability for the admin to see that the document has been signed. WIth these, iteration 1 should be considered complete
as a product that can viably handle the basic requirements requested by the accutech team.

## Things Clarified

As we continue, we should have less hiccups trying to figure out how to get the environment to work. We're gaining more knowledge
about how to use the development, and can continue work on the backend and the frontend.
