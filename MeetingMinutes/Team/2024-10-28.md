## Topics Discussed

For this meeting, we focused on the next set of tasks to handle. We have finished up  a large majority of the endpoints, offering
the following functionalities:
- Admin are able to view a list of documents
- Admin are able to upload a document to the database

We now better understand how to connect and use the database. With the major initial hurdles out of the way, it is just a matter
of taking the new functions that we have created and applying them to our other features. We used this meeting to delegate 
tasks.

## Things Clarified

The current priorities are:

- Levi will be working on the ability to view jobs that have been sent to clients, and connecting it to the database.
- Riley will be working on connecting the database to the uploaded files, to give admin a proper list.
- Tia will be working on fixing visual front end bugs and creating a front end for the client page.
- Hunter is working on creation of endpoints and vue functionality for the client page.
