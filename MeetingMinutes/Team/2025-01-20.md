## Topics Discussed

We used this meeting to discuss a few key points. First, automated testing is now fully working - which took us some time
and was a bit of a hassle, but we're all good there. Automated testing works for all the branches and is required for
pull requests to be approved. We also discussed how Hunter is no longer in the team, and how this will impact meetings. We
have set up a new schedule discussing what times we'll meet, and how that's changed. Riley is currently working on getting
the signature boxes to work, which is causing a few issues, but we should be fine to handle it. Tia finished up the GUI assignment
and we discussed GUI feedback we got from the project workshop.

## Things Clarified

The team members are working on the following goals:
- Levi: Creating a proper audit trail that can be viewed
- Tia: Working on small GUI changes and a larger GUI for the audit trail
- Riley: Further developments to the document edit system and trying to make signable widgets work.
