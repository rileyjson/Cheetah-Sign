## Topics Discussed

We used this meeting to wrap up our final plans for the meetings tomorrow, as well as the presentation on Wednesday. We have
finished up several vital features, and are ready to show them off! We've run into a slight issue that we plan on taking
care of tomorrow, as well. Overall, we are happy with the Audit trail functionality and the document builder functionality.
The ability to click instead of guessing coordinates is much nicer, and we greatly prefer it overall. The UI for the document
builder also looks significantly nicer.

## Things Clarified

The team members are working on the following goals:
- Levi: Fixing up some final bugs with trying to send documents.
- Tia: Stylizing for the audit trail and putting finishing touches on the presentation.
- Riley: Working on the signature and the user documentation.
