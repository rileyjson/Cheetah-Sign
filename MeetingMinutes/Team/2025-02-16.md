## Topics Discussed

We used this meeting to discuss our progress so far. Levi has made a data fixture that creates a database
holding test data, making it significantly easier to test the back end! This is implemented with a few additional
tests, taking into account the feedback from the iteration 3 meeting. Riley is focused on testing the front end, as well
as working on the functionality for the document editor. Tia has been focused on mocking up concepts for the design,
making it look less like it is in a production environment, which was also feedback we got from the iteration 3 meeting.

## Things Clarified

The team members are working on the following goals:
- Levi: Working on making more tests for the back end, and then moving on to feature design.
- Tia: Making the whole environment look smoother, resulting in less of a production feel.
- Riley: Focusing on implementing more front-end tests and then moving on to feature design.
