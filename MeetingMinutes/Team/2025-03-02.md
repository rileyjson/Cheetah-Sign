## Topics Discussed

This meeting was used to discuss the work we've got going on with the features. It's important for us to properly prioritize
our plans for the client functionality now that we've got better testing systems in place. This includes making sure the text
boxes can use names as well as potentially recording client information for easy access and use.

## Things Clarified

The team members are working on the following goals:
- Levi: Ensuring test coverage works and feature functionality.
- Tia: Creating the front-end design for the client page.
- Riley: Frontend pipeline implementation and names on text boxes.
