## Topics Discussed

This meeting was used as our wrap-up meeting! We have the mentor and client meetings both planned for tomorrow, and the software
is very close to complete! A few tidy ups should make everything in a presentable state for these meetings. Because of this, we
used this time to focus on what documents we'd like to make an emphasis tomorrow, and how we plan to present all of our documents
and features tomorrow.

## Things Clarified

The team members are working on the following goals:
- Levi: Working on updating the documentation as well as tidying up some functionality for the client profiles.
- Tia: Tidying up the front end from the previously created functionality and working on the presentation slides.
- Riley: Tidying up tests and functionality, as well as the presentation slides.
