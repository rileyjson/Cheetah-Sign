## Topics Discussed

This meeting was to help kick-off our efforts towards iteration 5. We used this starting time to help revamp the
UI and work on the lineup of boxes for the document builder. We've also started preparations for our RSVP for the 
symposium. The website looks better, and we have our plans prepared to start work on iteration 5.

## Things Clarified

The team members are working on the following goals:
- Levi: Changing the backend to create a new copy of a document for each created job.
- Tia: General UI improvement and poster for the symposium.
- Riley: Working on the form to fill out documents.
