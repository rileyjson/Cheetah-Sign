## Topics Discussed

Developments are going strong on iteration 5! Levi has fixed backend testing so that non code-running files have been
excluded (endpoints and migrations). This will make the code coverage count more accurate. Riley has been working on
drag-and-drop as well as resizing of document editing. Tia has been working on posterboard design and well as UI changes.

## Things Clarified

The team members are working on the following goals:
- Levi: Development of back-end testing and saving the job files.
- Tia: Poster design and continued work on front-end and UI changes.
- Riley: Further development of document editing and refinement of resizing.
