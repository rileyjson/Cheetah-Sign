## Topics Discussed

We spent this time finalizing the important parts of our project as we prepare for the final day tomorrow. One of the very
important things that we were focusing on was the development of the integration tests, which have been giving us a few issues.
Primarily, we were having difficulty connecting to the test database with the connection string offered in the normal
PgDataFixture, but we are fixing this by creating an integration test specific pg fixture. We are prepared to finish up
the project tomorrow in time for the iteration 5 due date.

## Things Clarified

The team members are working on the following goals:
- Levi: Developing more back-end tests and finishing touches on client page.
- Tia: Design of presentation and UI changes.
- Riley: Focusing on front-end and integration tests.
