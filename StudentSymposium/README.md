Levi: The student symposium was a very cool experience! I appreciated the chance to interact with other students
about their projects and to see what efforts others have put into their own projects. The symposium has a primary
purpose in helping students learn how to present their findings in the most effective way possible, to both individuals
that are experienced in the field and those who are not. Being able to explain the work that I have done in a group
setting to others will be very important in job settings. Furthermore, it made me think about the project in 
interesting ways - what aspects did I not accomplish, how could I have changed the process of development - these aspects 
have changed my perception and my workflow in future projects.
